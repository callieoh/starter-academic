As a member of the Swetland Center for Environmental Health at Case Western Reserve University, I joined the Ohio COVID-19 child care study research team. The goal of our study was to understand and lessen the impact of COVID-19 among staff and families in child care programs throughout Ohio. I onboarded child care administrators and provided study participation information.

We collected data from 10 counties in Ohio using qualitative and quantitative methods. I developed protocol for conducting COVID-19 tests for participating child care staff and families. We were able to observe COVID-19 transmission rates and trends among child care programs in Ohio.

Using qualitative methods, I wrote protocol for focus groups and facilitated the focus group discussions among child care administrators. I then coded the focus group transcripts using NVivo software on a priori and emergent themes.
